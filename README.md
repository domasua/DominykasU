I'am hard-working, motivated and enthusiastic person. I always strive to achieve the highest standard possible, at any given task and in any situation. I am accustomed to working in a challenging and fast-paced environment, particulary when dealing with multiple projects and priorities at the same time.

Additionally I am in progress of teaching myselft programing. My current focus are Java and Android studio. I am using Android Studio platform at this moment to build up few Android application apps: discount scanner wallet, freelancer services application and Q&A curriculum vitae robot.
